            <p>College is stressful so it is very important for me to have ways to manage the stress and take care of my mental health! Below are just a few example of what I do at college to lower my anxiety and stress.

                <p>My main way of taking care of my mental health is through meditation. I start and end every day with a guided meditation on the Calm app shown above. I find that meditation is a great way for me to clear my head and release any tension
                    from the day.</p>
                <p>In addition to meditation, I also practice Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) throughout the day when I am feeling anxious or stressed. Tapping allows me to move past these stressful or anxious situations and continue on with my day.</p>
                <p>While meditating I like to burn sage to cleanse my room and space of all negative energy. In addition to sage, I sometimes burn seagrass and palo santo wood.</p>

                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>Hiking has always been an important part of my life ever since I was little. My mom would take us on mandatory family hikes every weekend when I was young. I have grown to love hiking because it allows me to be in nature and get away from
                    the stress of school for a couple hours! It has been super fun finding new hiking spots in Michigan.

                <p>Handing out with my friends is super important for my mental health. College can be very stressful so having friends to support you is very important. I love to cook dinner or go out to a movie with my friends on the weekend.

            <p>Above is a photo of me playing tennis. I love to play tennis to release stress and get exercise. I go play tennis with my friends next to Palmer field. In addition to tennis, I love to surf in LA. I go super early in the morning with my Dad
                or friends. Unfortunately there is no surf in Ann Arbor, but I joined the lake surfing club at Michigan.
